              <h3>.1st-project{</h3>after 2 weeks of learning html and css basics, this was created as a final project of the DCI orientation course. 
              Central element is a flexbox img gallery with a hover effect as a means of navigation. It was a challenging but fun project to work on as I was able to put the puzzle of what I had previously been presented together. Looking back I would have liked to clear up the code a bit more since I left the project with the feeling of having created a huge mess.
              The topic presented in this simple info page is the country french-guyane, which i visited in 2019 for a short internship at the European Space Agency ESA. After successfully completing the orientation course, I was accepted into the full year course at DCI where i now proceed my journey to become a Fullstack Web Developer.<span class="spansize" >}</span>

              <h3>.2nd-project{</h3>
             A small side project in the early days of the DCI full year course. I simply wanted to play around with hover effects and transitions some more. Also it was first meant to be part of a bigger group-project with my classmates aiming to create a website as a collection of useful resources for the course.
             I uncluded logos of the first 3 Cheat Sheets we had been presented with in the course as my team was initially supposed to build a landing page. Unfortunately the group didn't pursue the project any further which is why I used my draft to simply link some of the ressources I had already collected and used for my own learning process. In addition it was the first project i deployed on github pages and I was able to gather first experience with Bootstrap. <span class="spansize">}</span>

              <h3>.3rd-project{</h3>
              This was the first group project I was part of. It was created during the first weeks of the DCI full year courses' UI/UX part. The task was to create a landing page for a fictional company. The project was a great experience as it was the first time I worked with git and github in a team. Since i was unvoluntaryly announced the teamlead, I learned a lot about the importance of communication and the need to be able to work in a team. I also learned a lot about the importance of planning and structuring a project. Despite issues with my liberal leading style, the project was a great experience and I am looking forward to working on more projects in the future.<span class="spansize">}</span>
